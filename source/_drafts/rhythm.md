Every team has a unique personality and dynamic.  Some teams vary in how they organize their work -

1.  Whole team, beginning to end, transparency, usually quite small.
1.  Mini-waterfall - works for some teams - don't hate on it!
1.  Opinionated Product Owner - likes clarity and defined roles

Other teams vary in how they figure out what their work is - They are just one part of a business, and that business is usually selling, delivering, and supporting the software product.

Part of the delivering is figuring out what to develop. Teams vary in how they figure out what to develop.  Could be top-down, could be marketing driven (gotta check those boxes!), could be user driven, or could be innovation driven.

I have written about the segregation of user experience and design and how separating that into it's own process feels wrong to me.    But that's not the point of this post.

I want to talk about how you, the tester on a team, has a huge influence in the team's cadence.  What, you have more than one tester?  Then your team is probably too big!  MOre on right-size teams later.

Given that the team's job is to deliver software, YOUR job is to deliver feedback and find bugs in a way that works with the team's flow.  I like to think of it as leading an orchestra.
