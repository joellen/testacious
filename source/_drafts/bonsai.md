What does the product owner own?  If the product owner owns the product, what do you call the other folks who work on the product and nurture it to delivery? Sharecroppers, perhaps?  Even though I learned social studies from the high school baseball coach, I seem to recall that sharecroppers were not the most empowered members of society at the time.

Sure, that's an extreme analogy, and most product owners are decent human beings doing the job they're paid to do.  But as a wise man named Raj once said, "Words mean things."  So taken literally, the term 'product owner' is just plain wrong.  The product owner does **NOT** own the product.

So what term more accurately reflects the role of the person who has primary responsibility for researching and proposing products, features, and changes to both?  Product Steward?  Product Nurterer?  Bonsai expert?

Think about it for a second.  Bonsai take careful pruning - just like a software product.  Consider the analogies:

* If allowed to grow unrestrained, then the plant will quickly outgrow the nutrients in the soil of it's container.

A product that only adds features and never takes anything away will become a maintenance hog.  Newer features will likely need to take advantage newer technologies, while older features will rely on legacy code.  Your team will get stretched to the max patching together legacy code and adding new features on top it.  Instead, keep your product free of dead weight, in both code and features, so you can move quickly to deliver killer features.

* If pruned haphazardly or wired in the wrong direction, then the plant will be improperly balanced, both physically and aesthetically.

We've all seen the Franken-product.
