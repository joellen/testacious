Agile is supposed to be all about transparency. That was its biggest appeal to me, and also the hardest lesson to learn.

The appeal lay in having all the pieces to the puzzle. Understanding the motivation, the goals, seeing the design process unfold, having a deep understanding of the why helped me approach testing with a wide scope. A scope that was wide in both process, in that it encompassed conceptualization, design, delivery, and support, and also wide in the types of testing I could do. I could 'test' designs by asking the 'what if' questions about prototypes; I could 'test' delivery by watching stats and seeing feature uptake. I could 'test' after delivery by looking at support requests.

I could, and did, do all those things and reveled in feeling like I contributed to the creation of this thing with my team mates. However, I struggled with allowing the same sort of transparency into my work. While test pass/fail results are easily shared, the 'thinking' and 'playing with it' part of testing is difficult to reduce to a scheduled task or chore, and thus difficult to be transparent about. It's hard to plan when you're going to stumble into a big bug, and trust me, most big bugs are found by exploring, not by scripted or scheduled test session. Most big bugs are also not found by story-level testing either; it's mostly when multiple stories come together that the potential for system havoc emerges.

I rejoiced when Elisabeth Hendrickson's book Explore IT was published - she suggests multiple ways of making the really valuable stuff that testers do visible to the team. Teams seem to like that.

Managers like that, too. So do directors, VP's, CTO's, etc. And that's all wonderful. Yay, everyone can see what the team is working on and re-direct on an hourly basis, if necessary. I've been fortunate to work on small teams so far, so the trail of visibility never had to go very far. However, now that I'm working in organizations that are 'scaling agile', my inner hippie is telling me that the transparency is one-way.

We're still working for the man. He's a nice man, for sure, and provides lunches, adult beverages, and ping pong tables at work. However, I've been drinking way too long to get excited about a few beers at the office.

I'm not complaining, I willingly entered this arrangement and enjoy my co-workers and the work I do. We all benefit from agile. But the most basic principle of agile, transparency, doesn't scale beyond the team.

Do you know what your CTO did yesterday and what he's working on today? Does your development manager ever encounter an impediment that she needs help with? I didn't think so. A top-down management structure, complete with closed door meetings and edicts from on high, is intrinsic in most companies, and agile doesn't change that.

Agile coaches who help companies with an 'agile transformation' maintain that changing the corporate culture is the hardest part of a transformation. When small agile teams are successful and then try to 'scale', is there a similar transformation? Does the transparency of agile scale also? Should it?

First, let's be honest that most companies want to make money. It's great to be the best at something and/or change the world, but ultimately businesses need to make money to stay in business. How do businesses make money? By selling a better widget or getting the widget to market before the next guy or gal. Software companies make money by selling working, reliable software. Working, reliable software is made by high-performing teams
