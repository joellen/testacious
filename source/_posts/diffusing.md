I felt quite defiant in my last post "Ripe for Revolution". Like all good ideas, however, my thoughts were far from original.  At about the same time, Christin Weidemann ran a session at STPCon Spring 2015 called [Let’s Start a Test Revolution – A Team-Based Approach to Test Innovation](http://www.stpcon.com/sessions/lets-start-a-test-revolution-a-team-based-approach-to-test-innovation/). I didn't attend, and I don't know Christin,  but I'm super curious about her ideas.  New item on my to-do list...

Drowning
========

Lately I've been thinking about the boundaries we as testers tend to accept on our teams.  Perceived boundaries, or rigid role assignments, can keep us from learning or exploring outside of our comfort zone.  This **not my job** mentality, or in some cases, **not your job** mentality, can lead to a diffusion of responsibility that erodes team potential.  The Houstonia highlighted [diffusion of responsibility](http://www.houstoniamag.com/news-and-profiles/articles/the-complicated-truth-about-children-and-drowning-april-2015/) as a potential contributor to child drownings -  "having too many supervising adults present might make a drowning more, rather than less, likely."

Pretty shocking.  More babysitters does not equal less risk. That's probably the only reason my kids survived - too few babysitters -- jk!!

The Houstonia quote vaguely reminded me of the **too many cooks in the kitchen** colloquialism - too many people trying to run the show. Two extremes, yes? No one is responsible or everyone is responsible.  Neither one works.

What does work?  Designated roles and responsibilities are often recommended as an antidote to diffusion of responsibility. Hence lifeguards at swimming pools.  Assuming a task falls within a designated area of responsibility, then someone will assume responsibility for that task.  Managers will manage, developers will develop, and testers will test.  Sounds very efficient, doesn't it?

A static team structure with rigid roles and responsibilities leads to silos and specialization, which can be very effective.  Work gets cranked out, like a machine.  Specialists get really good at what they do. Testers can specialize also - in automation, in manual testing, in mobile, in performance.

Do designated roles and responsibilities also work for the opposite problem - too many cooks?  I suspect so, once a leader is recognized and accepted.  Then the leader organizes and directs work.  Ideally (there's that word again!), the leader guides rather than dictates, allowing the team to self-organize around goals and deliverables and constraints.  At work, organizational hierarchy, and hiring and firing responsibility, makes the mantle of leadership perfectly clear, even in ostensibly flat organizations.

My interpretation of agile principles is on the idealistic side of the scale, particularly where self-organization is concerned. The team collectively assumes responsibility for delivery.  Everyone gets a voice in what gets delivered and how that happens.  In my ideal world, although team members have expertise in a particular area, the boundaries between areas are fluid.  A fluid team organization nurtures innovative solutions and skill development - a team driven by curiosity and commitment can come up with innovative solutions that help a product or company get in the Gartner report.

However, when taken too far, the innovative, inspired team can reek of developer anarchy.  Theoretical discussions can drag on forever because no one is empowered to make a final decision.  Too much innovation can de-rail delivery, when the team gets committed to a solution that obviously doesn't work, but no one has the perspective to throw it away and start over.  Testers can get involved in all phases of work, because there's very little actual delivery going on.

I suspect most of us work on teams somewhere in between.
