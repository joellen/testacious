Just to get this out of the way:

> _Testacious_ has nothing to do with testicles...

I've been testing software for awhile now. Just when I start to think I'm halfway good at it, something slips by me: a forgotten regression test, a production defect, a browser incompatibility. It is a humbling job. I've never thought I've had anything significant to offer the testing community. I still don't. That's not what this blog is about. I'm starting this blog for myself. To test _myself_. Not only professionally, but personally as well.

Last year, I challenged myself to take voice lessons for 6 weeks. Not because I can sing well — I know I can't. I wanted to know if I could _learn_ to sing well — well enough to overcome my anxiety and fulfill a silly dream of singing karaoke in public. Yes, I know the expectations for karaoke are low, yet I still am terrified. Of humiliation, of being less than perfect, of being judged. I still haven't made it to karaoke yet, but I still practice. I no longer take lessons, now I record myself at home now so I can practice until I feel ready. Baby steps.

_Testacious_ is another way I'm challenging my self.

_Testacious_ is a made up word, focusing this blog on my testing philosophy. But it's in good company with all these other real _-acious_ words -- check them out below.

* audacious
* bodacious
* capacious
* contumacious
* curvacious
* edacious
* efficacious
* fallacious
* fugacious
* gracious

* loquacious

* perspicacious
* pertinacious
* predacious
* pugnacious
* rapacious

* salacious
* sequacious
* spacious
* tenacious
* veracious
* vivacious

I hope this blog will be each of these at some point in time. Stay tuned.
