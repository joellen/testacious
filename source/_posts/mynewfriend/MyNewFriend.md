Meet my new friend -- Pomello!

Pomello is NOT the latest yoga trend, or an exotic fruit.  Pomello is a neat little Pomodoro timer that runs as a Chrome extension and integrates with Trello.  I discovered Pomello when I was looking for a way to simplify and prioritize my work in JIRA.  I was NOT looking for a pomodoro timer - but now that I'm using it, I feel like Pomello is my new BFF.

Pomodoro is a [time management technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) that involves working on a single task for a pre-determined time interval, followed by a short break.  That's one pomodoro cycle.  At the end of the cycle, you choose whether to continue the task, or start a new one. 

Pomello is designed to work with Trello, but beyond initial setup, does not require that you actually use Trello.  Since you can add tasks, move them between lists, and add notes to a task straight from Pomello, the Trello overhead is quite low.

Here's my Pomello technique:

I added a Trello board with lists to match my team's JIRA statuses.  I'll show you that in a bit.  It's not important because I rarely go into Trello. 

When I'm ready to start a task, I click on the  Pick a task link in the handy Pomello desktop tool. ![](pickatask.png).  I can choose a task from my current list, or switch to a different list. ![](pickatask2.png).

I can also add a new task without going to Trello at all.  I generally use the JIRA story id and title as my task name if there's a one-to-one correspondance.  I also have tasks for 'write up a bug' or 'prep for meeting' to keep track of adhoc tasks.

When my pomodoro work interval is complete, I can tell Pomello whether I finished the task, or if I want to work on it again.  If I finish the task, I can move it to another Trello board.  If I work on it again, Pomello keeps track of how many Pomodoro cycles I've spent on the task.

I can also add notes to my tasks at any time, which are saved as comments on the Trello card.  This is a handy way to keep a record of testing activities, or interruptions or tangents that came up.  If I like, I can copy these to my JIRA story to keep my testing visible to any one who's interested.

And then I get a break!  Getting in the pomodoro groove takes some mental discipline - discipline to stop what you're doing when the time is up, and also discipline to stay focused on the task for the entire time.  I close email and chats while I'm in a cycle.  It can be hard to resist the impulse to check email - but it's easier when I can look at my pomodoro timer and tell myself - I will check email in 11 minutes.

As a remote team worker, Pomello and pomodoro techniques are giving my day a rhythm that I like.  Sometimes I'm amazed at how little I get done in a cycle - setup for a particular test, deploying builds, etc.  all take time.


Finally, here's my Trello board.
