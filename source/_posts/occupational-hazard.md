It's entirely possible that the pain in my left quadriceps is a tumor. And my daughter will cancel her flight to Denver and not visit me.  And I'll get fired on Monday morning.  Possible?  Of course.  Anything is possible.  Probable?  That's a different story.

## Sanity check
I'm not paranoid.  Nor pessimistic. Nor even slightly psycho, despite my daughter's diagnosis.  Relatively sane, sadly.  For the last however many years, my day job has been to speculate all of the possible ways a software system can fail.  A side effect of this training is that I now see possible failures in everything.  Failures that may not be probable, but are still possible.  I like knowing these things.  I like feeling as if I'm, if not prepared, at least informed about  the worst possible thing that could happen in any given moment, and can then decide whether to prepare for that possibility.

## Risk assessment
The difference between personal risk assessment and professional risk assessment is quite different. As a software tester, one aspect of my job is to inform the team about risk.  Risk is a somewhat quantitative estimate of the impact of possible failures - how many users might encounter the failure, how severely are they affected, whether or not there are acceptable workarounds, and ultimately, is that cost worth the cost of preventing that failure.  I say somewhat quantitative because while we (my current team) don't crunch the numbers to quantify risk and explicitly include or exclude cases based on some threshold, we do our homework.  Server logs tell us how many errors and warnings customers encounter and also let us know when bad things are happening with performance and availability.  In-app instrumentation can tell us how many customers access a particular feature.  Everyone on the team has access to this data via Splunk, MixPanel, and New Relic, so we can put together a picture of risk and know where the possible AND probable failures may occur.  Finally, a weekly componentized release schedule means that if we do experience a regression or unleash a bug, we can quickly react and mitigate it.

## IRL
Not so much.  Sure, where illness is concerned, you can assess your hereditary and genetic risk of certain diseases and take preventive measures.  You can take safety precautions, such as changing the batteries in your smoke detectors and wearing your seat belt, to reduce your accident risk.

> "I'm committed to the _first_ 80%, but I'm bailing on the _last_ 20% because it's too hard."

Emotional risk doesn't follow those same principles.  Imagine the Pareto principle applied to a relationship -- "I'm committed to the first 80%, but I'm bailing on the last 20% because it's too hard."  Where do I sign up for that?   Plus, what are the external measures of relationship health?  Can I measure my relationship at 80% and say, yeah, I think we're good to go for the last 20%, so count me in?

So the trained habit of imagining possible failures and only preparing for the probable does not serve me well in my personal life. If I'm completely honest, this habit does not serve me well in the workplace either, since I'm constantly second-guessing my value to the team and their trust in my capabilities.

## Off switch
I'm able to turn off this thought pattern occasionally, and I imagine possible successes instead. That's when I buy lottery tickets :). And propose crazy ideas at the office that just might work.

Thanks for listening!
