I've been testing software since 2001, and am currently working with the PivotalTracker team in sunny Denver, Co. Opinions expressed here are my own, not those of my current, past, or future employers.

I like figuring out how things work...and don't work.  Part of that is figuring out how the team works, and how, when, and where I can make positive contributions.

I love to run, do yoga, mountain bike (although I am currently (and sadly) bike-less), hike, read, and learn.  I hope to add writing to that list.  Let's see how it goes.
