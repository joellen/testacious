[![Me](about-me/selfie.jpg "It's me!")](/about-me/selfie.jpg)

I've been testing software since 2001, and am currently working remotely from sunny Denver, CO for a mobile ordering platform provider in NYC. Opinions expressed here are my own, not those of my current, past, or future employers.

I like figuring out how things work...and don't work.  Part of that is figuring out how the team works, and how, when, and where I can make positive contributions. Another part of that is figuring out how I work and where I belong.

I love to run, do yoga, mountain bike (although I am currently (and sadly) bike-less), hike, read, and learn.  I hope to add writing to that list.  Let's see how it goes.  It's been a long time since Hardaway High School yearbook copy editing.
